# Online learning applications: Reinforcement Learning 

*This project was developed between July and September 2024, at Politecnico of Milan.* 

The goal of the project is to design online learning algorithms to handle a marketing campaign to sell products. This includes:
* **An advertising campaign**
* **A pricing problem**

The agents must determine the optimal bids and prices within a fixed time horizon, minimizing regret compared to a clairvoyant agent. The trade-off between learning and leveraging is also considered.


Details of the project can be found at [requirements.pdf](https://github.com/lorenzofranze/auction-and-selling-campaign/blob/main/requirments.pdf)

The project is divided into 4 (+1 bonus) requirments, here a rough list:
* Requirement 1: **stochastic environment**
* Requirement 2: **adversarial environment**
* Requirement 3: two extensions for **pricing (noise + non-stationary)**
* Requirement 4: Compare different **bidding algorithms**
* Requirement Bonus: handle multiple products using **two-dimensional Gaussian processes**


See [results.pdf](https://github.com/lorenzofranze/auction-and-selling-campaign/blob/main/results.pdf) fot the final results
