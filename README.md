# Online learning applications: Reinforcement Learning 

*This project was developed between July and September 2024, at Politecnico University of Milan.* 

The goal of the project is to design online learning algorithms to handle a marketing campaign to sell products. This includes:
* An advertising campaign
* A pricing problem

The agents have to find the right bids and prices in a fixed time horizon, minimizing the regret w.r.t a clairvoyant agent, trade-off between learning and leveraging is taken into consideration.


Details of the project can be found at [requirments.pdf](https://github.com/lorenzofranze/auction-and-selling-campaign/blob/main/requirments.pdf)

The project is divided into 4 (+1 bonus) requirments, here a rough list:
* Requirement 1: *stochastic environment*
* Requirement 2: *adversarial environment*
* Requirement 3: two extensions for *pricing (noise + non-stationary)*
* Requirement 4: Compare different *bidding algorithms*
* Requirment Bonus: handle multiple products using *two-dimensional Gaussian processes*


Have a look at [results.pdf](https://github.com/lorenzofranze/auction-and-selling-campaign/blob/main/results.pdf) to see final results

To run all the files use [run.ipynb](https://github.com/lorenzofranze/auction-and-selling-campaign/blob/main/src/run.ipynb) where it's possibile to set some parameters before the execution.
